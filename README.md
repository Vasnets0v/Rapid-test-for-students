# Rapid test for students
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a tool for mentors to assess the knowledge of their students. The tool allows students to take tests without the need for registration, making it easier and more accessible for them to participate. All students need to do is indicate their group, first name, and last name to begin the testing process.
